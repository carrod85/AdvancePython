# Homework 1
The general purpose of the exercise is to practice creating a python module and uploading it to the Pypi test environment, and afterwards using the created module.

1. Write a simple function that finds area of triangle. When writing your code, keep in mind that negative values are not possible.
The function inputs are base b and height h and returns the area S. https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-area-triangle-without-right-angle.html

2. Create a python module and add your program to that module.
Use 'triangle_yourusername' to name the module. When creating a module, be sure to pay attention to the contents of the setup.py, README.md and __init__.py files.

3. Upload the module to the Pypi TEST(!) Environment at https://test.pypi.org/

4. Reinstall the module in your computer. Make sure the installation was successful, if necessary remove the previous version with the 'pip uninstall' command.

5. Write a program that imports the module you created, asks for b and h, and prints out area.

6. Write some tests to test the module. Pay attention to tests naming convention 'test_***.py'

7. Zip the created module and the program using the module and tests and upload it to Moodle. Also include a link to the module in the test environment as a single line text file: e.g.: https://test.pypi.org/project/triangle_your username/



Please do not upload to Moodle any 'garbage' that may occur when using different IDEs! (folders like .idea, __MACOS etc.)

NB. To prevent problems reinstalling the module, use underscores, not hyphens, in folder names in the tree structure.

Grading: 15 points + 5 extra points for using graphic user interface (GUI).

Questions are welcome! Use teams, Moodle forum or einar.kivisalu@taltech.ee
